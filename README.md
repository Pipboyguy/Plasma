## Introduction

A FastAI-like utility library built on top of Pytorch.
The main intent behind Plasma to be simple to understand and easy to use. 

Some minimal inspiration taken from Ian Pointer's [Programming PyTorch Deep Learning Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-PyTorch-Deep-Learning-Applications/dp/1492045357/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=Programming-PyTorch-Deep-Learning-Applications&qid=1608157387&sr=8-2).
